I have a degree in Computer Science. Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and concepts such as Responsive Design and Mobile First. Good analytical, reasoning and creativity skills.

Currently, I try to improve my development and programming skills, creating small projects, to develop experiences with practical problem solving using computing.
