As a Front-end Developer, in addition to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, I have in my dev toolbox technologies such as SASS, Git, Github, React, Styled Components, Figma and concepts such as web design responsive and mobile first. Also, I have a degree in Computer Science.

Currently, I seek to improve my development and programming skills, creating small projects, to develop experiences with practical problem solving using programming, in addition to courses focused on the area.
